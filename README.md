In this project, I have built an automated dashboard for the finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams at a hypothetical company called Atliq Hardware, to help them analyze the data effectively for better decision-making.

# Problem Statement: 

AtliQ Hardware's growth has led to an expansion in operations across different regions.
The company now faces the challenge of analyzing a large volume of data for effective decision-making.
Previous analysis in Microsoft Excel proved insufficient for their needs.

# Solution: 

As a Data Analyst, I have developed an automated dashboard using Power BI.
The goal is to provide actionable insights and derive meaningful patterns from a dataset containing 4 million transaction records.
